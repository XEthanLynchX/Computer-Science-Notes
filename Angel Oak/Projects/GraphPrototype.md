## Overview

**GraphPrototype** is a TypeScript-based template designed to abstract and simplify interactions with the Microsoft Graph API. It provides a foundational structure for building client-side services that perform common Microsoft 365 tasks such as retrieving user data, sending emails, and managing calendar events. This prototype laid the groundwork for the more robust **GraphClient** implementation.

## Role

- Designed and implemented the initial **GraphPrototype** to explore and validate integration patterns with Microsoft Graph
- Established core abstractions for authentication, request handling, and error management
- Created modular service methods to support common Office 365 operations
- Documented architecture and usage patterns to support future development
- Used the prototype as a launchpad for building the production-ready **GraphClient**

---

## Impact

- Accelerated development of **GraphClient** by providing a tested and modular foundation
- Reduced complexity and improved maintainability of Microsoft Graph API integrations
- Improved team collaboration and onboarding through clear documentation and reusable patterns
- Served as a sandbox for testing Graph API behaviors and refining architectural decisions
