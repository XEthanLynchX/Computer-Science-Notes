- We first have it in test and then it goes into the "staging slot"
- Go to the Staging slot then deployment and deployment center check logs to see if it deployed
- check config under setting and make sure everything is the same
- Lots of testing from test > staging(before pushing into test)
- Go to deployment slots and swap the staging for the prod
