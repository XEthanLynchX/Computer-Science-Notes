### Design preference 
- Single Entry & Single Exit
- Happy Path at the end and return at the bottom 
- Ideally set error and don't throw in the middle if possible 

--- 

## Importing / Exporting 
- Always create `index.ts` file in the root of folders to then import all classes, types, functions, etc and the export those from the `index.ts` 

---

## Naming Conventions 
- The names of the files, classes, types, interfaces, and functions should be in **PascalCase** 
- The names of variables should be in **camelCase**
