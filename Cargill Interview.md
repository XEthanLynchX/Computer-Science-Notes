## What I did well: 
- Used the STAR method when talking about experiences I've had 
- Asked good questions at the end of the interview 
- Got the data base normalization question partially correct on the spot 
## Topics I was asked about: 
- What's the difference between http and https and why is it important? 
- What is database normalization and why is it important 
- What is a project you have worked what technologies did you use and what obstacles did you encounter and how did you overcome them 

## What to improve upon: 
- Don't say obviously EVER when you answering a question because it's not "obvious" ( If you get it wrong looks bad)
- Make sure to practice answering with clear speech don't stutter or lose train of thought when talking about something/ experience 

## Interesting thing to note
- I was actually given time to look up the difference between http and https and then explain what it was to interviewer
