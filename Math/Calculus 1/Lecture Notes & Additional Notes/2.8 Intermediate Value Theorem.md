## Statement of the Theorem
If:
- A function **f** is continuous on a closed interval [a, b], and  
- **N** is any number between f(a) and f(b),  

then there exists at least one **c ∈ (a, b)** such that: f(c) = N


---

## Intuition
- A continuous function has no jumps, breaks, or holes.  
- If the function takes on two values at the endpoints of an interval, then it must take on **every value between them** at some point in the interval.  
- Think of drawing the graph without lifting your pencil: you must pass through all intermediate y-values.

## Example 1: Root Existence
Suppose: f(x) = x³ - x - 2

- f(1) = -2  
- f(2) = 4  

Since 0 lies between -2 and 4, the IVT guarantees at least one root **c ∈ (1, 2)** such that f(c) = 0.

---

## Example 2: Value Between Endpoints
If:
- f(0) = 0  
- f(10) = 20  

Then for any **N ∈ (0, 20)** (say, N = 4), IVT ensures that there is some **c ∈ (0, 10)** with f(c) = 4.

---

## What IVT Guarantees
- The existence of a solution to f(c) = N.  
- At least one value c, but possibly more.  
- Works only if f is continuous.  

---

## What IVT Does *Not* Guarantee
- The exact value of c. (IVT does not give location, just existence).  
- The uniqueness of the solution (there may be multiple c’s).  
- Anything for discontinuous functions.

## Common Applications
1. **Proving roots exist** (showing a polynomial has a real zero).  
2. **Bracketing methods in numerical analysis** (like bisection method).  
3. **Showing solutions exist to equations** when algebraic solving is hard.  

---

## Practice Quick Checks
1. True or False: Every polynomial of odd degree must have at least one real root.  
   - **True** (follows from IVT and limits as x → ±∞).  

2. If f(a) = 2 and f(b) = 2, can IVT guarantee a root between a and b?  
   - **No**, unless f actually crosses 0 somewhere in (a, b). IVT only guarantees values between f(a) and f(b).  

3. A continuous function that changes sign 3 times on (0, 1) has at least how many roots?  
   - **At least 3**.
