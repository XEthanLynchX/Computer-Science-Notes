# Derivatives – Definition

The derivative of a function tells us how fast the function is changing at a given point.  
It is the slope of the tangent line to the curve.

## Formal Definition

For a function f(x), the derivative at x = a is:

f'(a) = lim (h → 0) [ f(a + h) - f(a) ] / h

(when the limit exists) (You don't have to check in Calc 1 though)

## Common Notations

- f'(x)
- dy/dx
- df/dx
- Df(x)

---

## Key Ideas

- The derivative is the **instantaneous rate of change**.  
- If f(x) is position, then f'(x) is **velocity**.  
- If a function is differentiable at x = a, then it is also continuous at x = a.  
- But being continuous does not always mean being differentiable.

## Geometric Meaning

- The derivative gives the **slope of the tangent line** at a point.  
- Locally, the function looks like a straight line with this slope.

## Example

Let f(x) = x²

f'(x) = lim (h → 0) [ (x + h)² - x² ] / h  
       = lim (h → 0) [ 2xh + h² ] / h  
       = lim (h → 0) (2x + h)  
       = 2x

So, the derivative of x² is **2x**.
