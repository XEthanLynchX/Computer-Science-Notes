---
## **Note: 
- You can do this cleverly by instead of looping through each combination of numbers you sacrifice some memory and store some numbers to find the **"Difference"** 

---

## **Time and Space Complexity: 
- Time is O(n) - Worst case we have to loop through the whole array 
- Space is O(n) - Worst case we have to store every element in the array
