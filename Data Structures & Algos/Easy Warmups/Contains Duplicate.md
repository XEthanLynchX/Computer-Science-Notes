## Note: 
- Be careful of using range(len(nums)) instead of i in nums
- The first case i is is the index (0,1,2,3, etc)
- Second case i is the actual # (1, 2, 2 ,3 ,5, 7, etc)
- Use Array to keep track of 

## Time and Space Complexity: 
- Space is O(n) - Seen array will be up to as large as our dataset
- Time is O(n) - Will scale based on size of array "n"
