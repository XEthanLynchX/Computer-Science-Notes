## **Problem: ![[Sqrt Problem.png]]


---
## **Note: 
- Binary search is the most optimal for this problem since we are searching for a target value 

---

## **Time and Space Complexity: 
- Time is O(log x) - This achieved through binary search as we are splitting our search size each time
- Space is O(1) - Only things we are storing are constant which are just our pointers
