## Notes: 
- Create a string that is set too alphabet to check against sentence
- Clear any whitespace from string and lowercase to match alpha string
- for each letter in alpha check if each letter is not in the sentence(pay attention to this wording)

---

## Time and Space Complexity
- Space is O(1) - Were storing 2 things which is constant O(1)
- Time is O(n) - The time we take to loop through is based on the size of the sentence
